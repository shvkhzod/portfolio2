I created a community of programmers and designers consisting of 2000 people on Instagram

## The reason

In 2021, I looked at Instagram and other resources, but could not find any source that was producing good Uzbek tech content. During that period, we were still mainly indoors, so content was firing up in all networks. So I wanted to create a community where people can share their knowledge, experience and ideas. I wanted to create a place where people can learn from each other and grow together. Plus, I wanted to consolidate my own knowledge by teaching others.

## The future

I am planning to create a website and a youtube channel where I will share exta knowledge and experience regarding to tech and design. I am also planning to create a special platform dedicated to learning skills related to technology and design. I am working on it these days, I think that it will be a great help for people who want to learn things on their own

## What I learnt
