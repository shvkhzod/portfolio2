## Problem

Academy did not have strong online presence, interested people could not find information about the academy. So it blocked the growth.

## Solution

I proposed a website that would have all the information about the academy, courses, teachers and etc. I included a blog section as well, where academy could share their knowledge and experience, and attract more people by creating content

## Typeface

After discussion with the client, I chose a typeface that would represent the academy's values and mission. I chose a typeface that would be easy to read and would look professional, so primary typeface is Space Grotesk and secondary typeface is Poppins.

## Colors

We went with blue as primary color, as it gives a sense of technology and trust. For secondary color we chose white, to emphasize the primary color. And for accent colors, the different hues of blue and green were chosen to give a sense of calmness and growth.

## The result

The website was not launched yet, the development is currently in pause. But I completed the design and initial phase of development and presented ready project to their development team. I hope they will launch it soon and it will help them to grow and reach more people.
