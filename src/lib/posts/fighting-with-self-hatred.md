I usually document things I am learning and experiencing. One of them is self-hatred.I decided to share some of my notes on that

I am feeling bad, take today as example. I literally did nothing and it's 15th. It means I almost wasted another month. No growth. I am 20. Incapable of doing something valuable or important

So immature, what's wrong with me?

It is happening a lot

All I can do is sleep, eat and groan. Disgusting

The only solution I see for this is "doing exceptionally good" or just get busy with something, so that I don't have time to think about it

Things seem to be heavy, but aren't they supposed to be like that?

I feel like I lost the control totally.

10:24 PM May 31, 2022  
Am I only the one who feels this way?

06:10 PM June 21, 2022  
Most of the time I think that I am wasting life. Waste, waste, waste

Indecisive . Just learn to choose

03:23 PM August 2, 2022  
We are here to be examined, it is supposed to be hard and painful

Biggest unhappiness is when someone hate oneself...

I know I deserve even worse

I have problems with self-acceptance, any type of media that includes me is strongly analyzed before putting it on the Net. I guess I am shy and coward too.

10:09 PM December 5, 2022  
I deserve it, I screwed it . 

03:56 PM  February 16, 2023
I somehow understand now what's like to feel lonely among people

04:25 PM March 17, 2023  
I make a lot of mistakes

07:55 AM June 27, 2023
