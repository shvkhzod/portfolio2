Everybody recommends reading. Do you want to be a better reason, do you want to be successful, then read a book.

With my little experience in reading(100+ books in 6 years), I concluded that sometimes reading does more harm than good.

It gives knowledge, which is a must in every field. It also gives you dopamine, creating an illusion that you are getting better, when in fact you are just unloading the soon-to-forgotten information to your brain.

I am not saying reading itself is bad, but being stuck in "learning cycle" is.
