I am a student at LSBU, studying BSc Computer Science. Before LSBU, I studied at SNU, South Korea, but I dropped out after 2 years due to corona virus. So in a field, where nobody really asks for a degree, why did I decide to go to university?

## I didn't want to grow up fast

Even though I was twenty, I felt that I needed some more time explore myself and the world. And university gave good amount of time to do that. My favorite place in my univeristy is library. I can spend hours there, reading books and learning new things in my laptop.Plus, I chose to study in London, which is one of the most diverse cities in the world. Moving here was totally different experience, I felt like as if I had just been unplugged from the matrix. So with university I was able to learn things that I really like and explore the world at the same time, without really worrying about the future for a while

## I am Asian bruh

I am from Uzbekistan, and in my country, education is very important, especially for parents. It is like a status symbol, Asian mindset. So this played a little role in this decision as well, I didn't want to disappoint my parents as they've done so many things for me

## Education is education

I am studying different subjects, and I find them interesting, it is not top quality, but expecting a lot from university is waste of time. I get topics and do a lot self study, by doing that I believe I am getting good preparation for my career. It is just different atmosphere here, a lot of people at the same of timeline of their lives with different backgrounds. You feel it, when you enter the campus, when you go inside the library,all these students trying to figure out things, it encourages you to learn .
