Artificial Intelligence is making things easier, faster and meaningless.
I have been using AI since December, 2022. It was dumb and slow, but fun at first.

It felt like Thanos's glove with inifinity stones. You think of something and snap your fingers.

I saved my time and energy by delegating my tasks to it. Ranging from simple emails to fully ready course works. Once you see the power of the thing, you cannot unsee it. Like why do I need to waste my precious hours on writing this boring essay, when I can have Shakespeare level essay in 30 seconds with AI, right?

No. After some time I realized that I don't feel the same way I did when I finished my tasks without it. There is always something missing inside me when I finish something with AI. I don't feel the ownership, pride and excitement. I just feel empty. It makes me depressed. When I generate an email with AI, my dignity gets attacked. Are you that dumb? Are you that dead? 

I have never been in a flow while using AI. But I clearly remember the times when I didn't feel the hours pass by while coding my projects. 

There is joy in doing things. There is a little play. There is a litle life in it. Even in boring tasks. If they are delegated to AI, then whole life is delegated to it.

You might say, what's the point of doing all these tasks yourself anyway. Then, what's the point of living, anyway? 

As humans we are obsessed with results only. The thing that makes the result valuable is the process. The process that requires effort and time. AI removes the process. Thereby, it takes away the proof of work. When you saw a text or book before, you had some confidence that someone actually spent some time writing it. Now you don't have that luxury.


MIT recently published a study proving that AI is making us dumber. I agree with them. If we are put in wildlife, most of us cannot survive at all. We are not like our ancestors that lived 1000 years ago. Technology made life easier and comfortable, so we forgot our survival skills, because we don't use it. But this time the loss will not be our physical abilities, but the mental ones. We will forget how to analyze, research, syntethize, write, anything we make AI do us for us. It is very pessimistic take. And probably, a hypocritical one too.

But that's why I say

LLMs are still bad with novelty. They cannot create something "new". They only rearrange already existing information.Originality derives from our uniquely personal experiences, from our thoughts in the shower, from our dreams,from the sound of the river,etc.

So, find a name yourself, write that email with your own individual voice, put some effort and analyze the large text yourself. Search from the books. Ask people. Sound boring. Take your time in doing things. 

In short, stay human. Please

I am going to end this essay with my quote inspired by Descartes. He once proved his existence with famous line:"I think, therefore I am"

I prove my existence with: "I do, therefore I am"
