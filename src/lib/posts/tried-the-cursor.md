![Cursor AI](/images/cursor.webp)

Well, after my X feed was flooded with Cursor posts, I decided to take a look at it.

## First Impressions
I started using Claude AI several months ago, I had enough data about AI writing code. I have to say, my experience was pretty bad. The reason is simple, it gave wrong answers a lot, and worst, it hallucinated, you know, it doesn't know how to say "I don't know" so it makes stuff up

With all these in mind, I installed Cursor. Entered, noticed that they copied all the interface from VSCode, pixel by pixel. 

## My project
After navigating through the interface, I finally got the all famous Cursor Composer. And I asked it to create a programming language with Uzbek keywords.

I really wanted to test it. It made lots of mistakes, sometimes silly ones, I have to correct literally every answer, every generation. But it delievered a programming langauge at the end
